        <p style="float: right;">Our system can predict regions which 
        have high probability for crime occurrence and can visualize crime prone areas. With the increasing advent of computerized systems, crime data analysts can help the Law enforcement officers to speed up the process of solving crimes. Using the concept of data mining.</p>

                <p>Data visualization technology can bring benefits to almost everyone within the police force – and benefits extend into the wider community. The more police are able to see the big picture, the higher the likelihood of crime getting solved quickly. <br>
                The public increasingly expects this kind of approach. And the shift in focus within agencies from solving crime to preventing it from happening is helping drive it.

            <p>A crime analyst is tasked with reviewing crime-related statistics/data or reports related to a particular police district or jurisdiction. They are also responsible for handling computer programs, such as databases, statistical analysis software and geographic information systems (GIS), which are used to prepare maps for law enforcement officers. <br>
            Crime analysts analyze statistics to identify trends and forecast future criminal activities. The ultimate goal of all this analysis is to help prevent crime.</p>
